"You have a solution \( H_2SO_4 \), Mr. = 98, mm = 0.5 g, m/m = 50%. Dilute it to 1 L, what will be its resulting pH?"

The handwritten solution attempts to calculate the molarity (n) of the solution, then the concentration (c) after dilution, and finally the pH of the resulting solution. Let's review the steps provided in the image:

1. The molar mass (Mr) of \( H_2SO_4 \) is given as 98 g/mol.
2. The mass of \( H_2SO_4 \) (mm) is given as 0.5 g.
3. The mass/mass percentage (m/m) is given as 50%, but this information is not used in the calculation. This is likely an error since the mass percentage should be used to calculate the amount of \( H_2SO_4 \) in the solution before dilution.
4. The molarity (n) of \( H_2SO_4 \) is calculated using the formula \( n = \frac{M}{Mr} \), resulting in \( n = 0.005 \) moles.
5. The concentration (c) after dilution is calculated using \( c = \frac{n}{V} \), where V is the volume after dilution to 1 L, resulting in \( c = 5 \times 10^{-6} \) M.
6. The pH is calculated using \( pH = -\log(c) \), where c is the concentration of \( H^+ \) ions. The pH is calculated to be 5.3.

However, there are a few points that need to be corrected:

- The m/m percentage should influence the initial concentration before dilution, which is not accounted for in the calculation.
- \( H_2SO_4 \) is a strong acid and fully dissociates in water, producing two \( H^+ \) ions per molecule, which should be considered when calculating the pH.

Let's correct the calculation by considering these points. We will first calculate the initial concentration of \( H_2SO_4 \) before dilution, then the concentration of \( H^+ \) ions in the diluted solution, and finally the correct pH.

```python
import math

# Given values
mass_H2SO4 = 0.5  # in grams
molar_mass_H2SO4 = 98  # in g/mol
volume_solution_l = 1  # after dilution, in liters

# Calculate moles of H2SO4
moles_H2SO4 = mass_H2SO4 / molar_mass_H2SO4

# Since H2SO4 is a strong acid and fully dissociates to release 2 H+ ions,
# the concentration of H+ ions will be twice the concentration of H2SO4
concentration_H_plus = moles_H2SO4 * 2 / volume_solution_l

# Calculate the pH
pH = -math.log10(concentration_H_plus)

concentration_H_plus, pH
```

Upon reviewing and correcting the calculation:

1. The number of moles of \( H_2SO_4 \) was correctly calculated as 0.005 moles based on the mass and molar mass.

   \[
   \text{Moles of } H_2SO_4 = \frac{\text{Mass of } H_2SO_4}{\text{Molar Mass of } H_2SO_4} = \frac{0.5 \text{ g}}{98 \text{ g/mol}} = 0.005 \text{ moles}
   \]

2. Since \( H_2SO_4 \) is a strong acid, it dissociates completely in water, releasing two \( H^+ \) ions for each molecule. Therefore, the concentration of \( H^+ \) ions in the solution after dilution to 1 L is 0.0102 M (twice the molarity of \( H_2SO_4 \)).

   \[
   \text{Concentration of } H^+ = 2 \times \text{Molarity of } H_2SO_4 = 2 \times 0.005 \text{ M} = 0.0102 \text{ M}
   \]

3. Using this concentration, the pH is calculated to be approximately 1.99, which is more acidic than the pH of 5.3 shown in your handwritten solution.

   \[
   \text{pH} = -\log(\text{Concentration of } H^+) = -\log(0.0102) \approx 1.99
   \]

So the correct pH of the solution after dilution is 1.99, not 5.3 as originally calculated. The mass/mass percentage given in the problem statement was not needed for the calculation since the actual mass of \( H_2SO_4 \) was provided. If the m/m percentage was to be used, it would be part of a different calculation where the total mass of the solution before dilution would be considered.
