Upon reviewing and correcting the calculation:

The number of moles of
�
2
�
�
4
H
2
​
SO
4
​
was correctly calculated as 0.005 moles based on the mass and molar mass.

Since
�
2
�
�
4
H
2
​
SO
4
​
is a strong acid, it dissociates completely in water, releasing two
�

- H
- ions for each molecule. Therefore, the concentration of
  �
- H
- ions in the solution after dilution to 1 L is 0.0102 M (twice the molarity of
  �
  2
  �
  �
  4
  H
  2
  ​
  SO
  4
  ​
  ).

Using this concentration, the pH is calculated to be approximately 1.99, which is more acidic than the pH of 5.3 shown in your handwritten solution.

So the correct pH of the solution after dilution is 1.99, not 5.3 as originally calculated. The mass/mass percentage given in the problem statement was not needed for the calculation since the actual mass of
�
2
�
�
4
H
2
​
SO
4
​
was provided. If the m/m percentage was to be used, it would be part of a different calculation where the total mass of the solution before dilution would be considered.​
