### Problem 7: Solution

1. Calculate the concentration of \( H^+ \) ions using the pH:

   - pH = 2.5
   - \([H^+] = 10^{-2.5}\)

2. Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

   - In a 100% acetic acid solution, \([A^-] = [H^+]\) (since it's a monoprotic acid)
   - Concentration of acetic acid (\(CH_3COOH\)) ≈ 0.562 M

3. Calculate the moles of acetic acid needed for a 1.5 L solution:

   - Approximately 0.843 moles

4. Convert moles to grams using the molar mass of acetic acid (60.05 g/mol):

   - Approximately 50.65 grams

5. Convert this mass to volume using the density of acetic acid (1.05 g/mL):
   - Approximately 48.24 mL needed for a 1.5 L solution with a pH of 2.5

### Problem 8: Solution

1. Calculate the amount of acetate in an 8 m/m% solution:

   - In 1000g of this solution, there are 80 grams of acetate

2. Mix the acetate solution with 3500g of water:

   - Total mass of the final solution = 4500 grams

3. Calculate the volume of the final solution assuming the density is close to water (1 g/mL):

   - Volume = 4500 mL

4. Calculate the mass/volume percentage concentration:
   - Concentration ≈ 1.78% m/V

Thus, you have 80 grams of acetate in a final solution volume of 4500 mL, resulting in a concentration of 1.78% m/V.
